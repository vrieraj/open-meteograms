# ðŸ“ˆ Meteogram Generator using Open-Meteo API

This repository contains tools and scripts to generate **meteograms** â€” graphical weather forecasts â€” based on meteorological data retrieved from the [Open-Meteo Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/). The project is designed for users who need fast, customizable visualizations of forecast data for specific locations, particularly for environmental analysis, fieldwork planning, or educational purposes.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Queries weather data from Open-Meteo's free API.
- Supports hourly and daily forecast variables (temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.).
- Custom meteogram plots using `matplotlib` and `pandas`.
- Modular Python code for easy reuse or integration in other projects.
- CLI or script-based generation of meteograms for any location (lat/lon).
- Open-source and well-documented.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

- Python â‰¥ 3.8  
- `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `argparse`  
- (Optional: `cartopy` or `geopandas` for spatial extensions)
